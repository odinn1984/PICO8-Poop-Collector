# Poop Collector
Simple 2D platformer game made with PICO-8, I must admit... This is a SHITTY game :)

## About
This game is a simple platformer where you need to collect poop in a limited amount of time to open the door and clear the level and move to the next one.

This game has 32 level each one with different amounts of poop to collect and different times to clear them.

## How to run?
Clone the repository with:
```bash
gh repo clone odinn1984/PICO8-Poop-Collector
```

Open PICO-8 and run the `folder` command to open the folder where the games are stored and copy the repository to that folder.

Navigate to the `poop-collector.p8` file inside PICO-8 and run 
```bash
load poop-collector.p8
``` 
and then execute the `run` command and play!
